Doing-Data-Science-Python
=========================

Python code for the Doing Data Science book (O'Neil, Schutt), [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do) and [Review](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/01/a-review-of-doing-data-science-by-rachel-sshutt-and-cathy-oneil.html).

Surely not an original idea, but a good way to continue learning Python, Pandas, scipy, sklearn etc. etc.

To run files, you'll also need to data sets for the book, available from https://github.com/oreillymedia/doing\_data\_science

Chapter 2 now in some sort of useful shape.
