# Chapter 2 #

This is an introductory chapter, and features two case studies: one (simulated) data from the New York Times, and one data from a fictional company.  Some simple R scripts are given to get you started, together with some prose instructions.

Probably I'll come back to this as I learn more.  For now, we have some IPython notebooks:

- NYT raw Python: Load the NYT data set and produce some plots, using just basic Python, numpy and matplotlib


## TODO ##

- Pandas version of NYT
- RealDirect case study
